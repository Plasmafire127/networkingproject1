## CS428 Project-1: Web Server

[This file uses Markdown, so please use correct Markdown syntax when editing the file]: #

### SUMMARY

[Provide a short description of your program's functionality, no more than a couple sentences]: #
This program spins up a webserver that handles HTTP requests using TCP connections. It creates a welcome socket, waits for a connection, and then spins up one or more other sockets to handle each HTTP object request. Webserver2 safely terminates after ^C. 
### NOTES, KNOWN BUGS, AND/OR INCOMPLETE PARTS

[Add any notes you have here and/or any parts of the project you were not able to complete]: #
N/A
### REFERENCES

[List any outside resources used]: #
Used all the resources provided for the TCP connection and file transfers (github pages in the assignment post). Also used stack overflow and geeksforgeeks for help implementing the multithreading of part 2.
### INSTRUCTIONS

[Provide clear and complete step-by-step instructions on how to run and test your project]: #
run "make" to compile the webservers. run "./webserver1 port#" or "./webserver2 port#" to start the webserver. In a browser, connecting via "127.0.0.1:port#/filename" should successfully work. There is also "make clean" to remove the compiled files.
